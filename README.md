# HeadHunters
CLEAR Hackathon 2018
## What is HeadHunters
HeadHunters is a fun face filter application created for Clear Hackathon 2018. This project was built using Unity and ARKitâ€™s Facial Recognition. It aims to increase awareness for Clear Shampoo in a fun and interactive way, specifically targeting millennials. During the development of the project, we worked closely with the Unilever business team to create the ideal prototype that will suit their use case.

## How does it work
Using the application, users can display digital filters on their hair and facial features. Similar to the Instagram Face Filters, users will be able to see themselves with objects superimposed onto them, learning about the advantages of using the Clear Shampoo in a fun and exciting way. Users can trigger filters using their facial movements like a smile or a blink. The application comes with three main features, namely the Dandruff filter, Sunglasses Blink filter and the Sakura Smile filter.

## Controls
#### Smile - Sakura Smile filter will be enabled
#### Shake your Head - Dandruff filter will result in dandruff to fall off your head
#### Left Blink - Sunglasses filter enabled
#### Right Blink - Sunglasses filter disabled
#### Click of Regular Shampoo - Dandruff on the hair will disappear but reappear after some time
#### Click of Clear Shampoo - Dandruff will disappear permanently
