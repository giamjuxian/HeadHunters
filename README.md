# HeadHunters
CLEAR Hackathon 2018

HeadHunters is a fun face filter application created for Clear Hackathon 2018. This project was built using Unity and ARKitâ€™s Facial Recognition. It aims to increase awareness for Clear Shampoo in a fun and interactive way, specifically targeting millennials. During the development of the project, we worked closely with the Unilever business team to create the ideal prototype that will suit their use case.
